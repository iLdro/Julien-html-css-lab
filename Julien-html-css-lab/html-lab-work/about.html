            <p>
                A spa is a location where mineral-rich spring water (and sometimes seawater) is used to give medicinal baths. Spa towns 
                or spa resorts (including hot springs resorts) typically offer various health treatments, which are also known as 
                balneotherapy. The belief in the curative powers of mineral waters goes back to prehistoric times. Such practices have 
                been popular worldwide, but are especially widespread in Europe and Japan. Day spas are also quite popular, and offer 
                various personal care treatments.

                A 'body treatment', 'spa treatment', or 'cosmetic treatment' is non-medical procedure to help the health of the body. It

                In the modern world spa therapies are linked to various domains including beauty, pampering, indulgence, and health. 
                Spa industry is thought to be growing at a significantly high rate, and most importantly it is observed to embrace 
                wellness as its core business. By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the 
                United States.
